# Systemdesign

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The owner of the DrivePass noticed a lack of training for student drivers. DriverPass wants to provide a better training option by building a system to help train student drivers before taking the test at the DMV. 

What did you do particularly well?

I think what I did particularly well is designing the requirements for the system. Design requirements are an extremely important part of creating well-working software. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part of the documents I would revise would be the functional and non-functional requirements because those requirement dictate the experience of the end-user.
